I am a passionate Software Developer with expertise in the AI and Fintech space. I have a deep interest in Web3 development, and I've built some amazing tools that have garnered attention, such as RadarFi and VoteX.

üåê Web3 Content Creator:In addition to my development work, I'm also a web3 content creator and the author of a popular newsletter called ["Web3 Bits n Bytes"](https://web3bitsnbytes.substack.com/) I enjoy sharing my knowledge and insights with others in the community. As an educator and seasoned engineer, I believe in the power of continuous learning and strive to contribute to the growth of the web3 ecosystem.
